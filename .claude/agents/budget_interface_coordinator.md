# budget_interface_coordinator

## Purpose

Phase 7 pre-gate action agent. Declared as `pre_gate_agent: budget_interface_coordinator` under `n07_budget_gate` in `manifest.compile.yaml`. Executes before `budget_gate_validator` evaluates `gate_09_budget_consistency`.

Reads WP structure and Gantt outputs to prepare a structured budget request payload conforming to the interface contract at `docs/integrations/lump_sum_budget_planner/interface_contract.json`. Writes the request to `docs/tier3_project_instantiation/integration/budget_request.json` for human handoff to the external Lump Sum Budget Planner.

This agent **does not declare the budget gate passed** and **does not compute budget figures**. Its sole purpose is request preparation.

## Canonical Output

`docs/tier3_project_instantiation/integration/budget_request.json`

This artifact is listed in `manifest.compile.yaml` artifact registry (`a_t3_budget_request`) with a note: "Produced by budget_interface_coordinator pre-gate action; not a gate condition."

## No Exit Gate

This agent carries `exit_gate: null` because it is a pre-gate action, not a primary gate executor. The exit gate of `n07_budget_gate` (`gate_09_budget_consistency`) is evaluated by `budget_gate_validator` after an external budget response has been received.

## Skill Bindings

### `budget-interface-validation`
**Purpose:** Validate budget request conformance to the interface contract before submission.
**Trigger:** After the budget request payload has been constructed from Phase 3 and Phase 4 outputs; validates it against the interface contract schema before writing.
**Output / side-effect:** Validation artifacts written to `docs/integrations/lump_sum_budget_planner/validation/`; request written to `docs/tier3_project_instantiation/integration/budget_request.json`.
**Constitutional constraints:**
- Must not generate or estimate budget figures.
- Must not accept a request that does not conform to the interface contract.
- Must not declare the budget gate passed if blocking inconsistencies exist.
- Must not treat absent response as a non-failing state.

### `decision-log-update`
**Purpose:** Write a durable decision record to the Tier 4 decision log whenever a material interpretation is made or a conflict is resolved.
**Trigger:** When interface contract interpretation decisions are made during request construction.
**Output / side-effect:** Decision log entry written to `docs/tier4_orchestration_state/decision_log/`.
**Constitutional constraints:**
- Decisions held only in agent memory do not constitute durable decisions.
- Every resolved tier conflict must produce a decision log entry.
- Decision log entries must identify the tier authority applied.

## Canonical Outputs

| Path | Tier | Provenance | Schema ID | Role |
|------|------|------------|-----------|------|
| `docs/tier3_project_instantiation/integration/budget_request.json` | tier3_integration | manually_placed | — | Structured budget request for human handoff to external system; not a gate condition |

## Contract

This agent is bound by `node_body_contract.md`. Steps 6–7 implemented below. Steps 8–9 (constitutional review notes; prompt specification) remain.

## Must-Not Constraints

Source: `agent_catalog.yaml` — enforced without exception.

- Must not compute, estimate, or invent budget figures.
- Must not deviate from the interface contract schema in request construction.
- Must not declare the budget gate passed.
- Must not fabricate a budget response in the absence of an external response.

Universal constraints from `node_body_contract.md` §3 also apply.

## Budget Constitution

CLAUDE.md §8.1–8.5 governs budget handling. This agent is an execution mechanism for §8.2 (prepare structured budget requests). It has no authority to execute any other budget activity.

## Output Schema Contracts

### `budget_request.json` — Pre-Gate Output (no schema_id in spec)

**Canonical path:** `docs/tier3_project_instantiation/integration/budget_request.json`
**Provenance:** tier3_integration (listed as `manually_placed` in artifact registry — note: `a_t3_budget_request` in manifest; "not a gate condition")
**Schema ID:** None defined in `artifact_schema_specification.yaml`

This artifact is not schema-bound in the spec. It is structured per the interface contract at `docs/integrations/lump_sum_budget_planner/interface_contract.json`, which is the governing schema. All payload construction must conform to that contract. The `budget-interface-validation` skill verifies conformance before this artifact is written.

Required content (from interface contract; agent must read the contract, not assume):
- WP-level effort data derived from `wp_structure.json` work_packages
- Period-level timeline data derived from `gantt.json` tasks
- Partner-level cost attribution derived from Tier 3 consortium data
- No budget figures computed or estimated by this agent — all numeric effort/cost fields must be flagged as "requires_external_computation"

`run_id` propagation: Include `run_id` in the request payload for traceability. This is not a schema-enforced field but is required by the constitutional obligation (CLAUDE.md §9.4) that outputs be traceable to a run.

**This artifact is not a gate condition** (manifest artifact registry note for `a_t3_budget_request`). Its absence does not cause a gate failure, but its presence and conformance are required before `budget_gate_validator` can validate a response.

## Gate Awareness and Failure Behaviour

### Predecessor Gate Requirements

**Predecessor:** `phase_06_gate` must have passed before `n07_budget_gate` is entered. This agent is the pre-gate action for `n07_budget_gate`; it runs within Phase 7 after `phase_06_gate` passes (edge `e06_to_07`).

Precondition check: `wp_structure.json` (schema `orch.phase3.wp_structure.v1`) and `gantt.json` (schema `orch.phase4.gantt.v1`) must be present and valid — verified by the Phase 3 and Phase 4 gate results having passed.

**Entry gate:** none (pre-gate agent).
**Exit gate:** none — this agent does not declare or evaluate any gate.

### Exit Gate

This agent has no exit gate. Gate authority for `n07_budget_gate` belongs to `budget_gate_validator`. This agent's sole responsibility is to produce a conforming budget request payload for human handoff.

### Failure Protocol

#### Case 1: Interface contract not found or unreadable
- **Halt:** If `docs/integrations/lump_sum_budget_planner/interface_contract.json` is absent, halt.
- **Write:** Decision log entry `decision_type: gate_failure`; the budget request cannot be constructed without the contract.
- **Must not:** Construct a request payload by guessing the schema from memory.

#### Case 2: Required upstream input absent
- **Halt:** If `wp_structure.json` or `gantt.json` are absent, halt.
- **Write:** Decision log `decision_type: gate_failure`; identify missing input.
- **Must not:** Populate WP or timeline fields by inference from other sources.

#### Case 3: Interface contract validation fails on the produced request
- **Halt:** Do not write a non-conforming request to `budget_request.json`.
- **Write:** Decision log `decision_type: scope_conflict` (contract vs. produced payload); identify the non-conforming field(s).
- **Must not:** Write a request that does not conform to the interface contract.

#### Case 4: Budget figure computation attempted
- **Halt immediately** — constitutional prohibition (CLAUDE.md §8.1, §8.3, §5.3 of agent-generation-plan.md).
- **Write:** `decision_type: constitutional_halt`; name the prohibited computation.
- **Must not:** Generate, estimate, or approximate any budget figure.

### Budget Gate Special Handling

This agent is a pre-gate action. It does **not** declare `gate_09_budget_consistency` passed or failed. It does **not** evaluate whether the budget is consistent. It does **not** substitute for an external budget response. Absent budget artifacts in `docs/integrations/lump_sum_budget_planner/received/` are not this agent's concern — that is `budget_gate_validator`'s unconditional blocking failure.

### Decision-Log Write Obligations

Write to `docs/tier4_orchestration_state/decision_log/`. Every entry: `agent_id: budget_interface_coordinator`, `phase_id: phase_07_budget_gate`, `run_id`, `timestamp`, `decision_type`, `rationale`, source references.

| Trigger | `decision_type` | Minimum entry content |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Interface contract field interpretation decision | `material_decision` | Field name; contract section; interpretation adopted |
| WP-to-request mapping decision (how WP data maps to request schema) | `material_decision` | WP IDs; contract fields; mapping basis |
| Contract field left empty because data not available | `assumption` | Field name; reason; what is needed |
| Interface contract validation failure | `scope_conflict` | Non-conforming field; contract requirement; what was produced |
| Budget computation attempted and halted | `constitutional_halt` | CLAUDE.md §8.1; the halted action |
